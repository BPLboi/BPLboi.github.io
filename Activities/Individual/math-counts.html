            <section id="overview">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>MathCounts is a mathematics competition for middle schoolers, that has local, state, and
                    national-level events. The questions asked focus on branches of math slightly outside of the usual
                    middle-school curriculum, such as combinatorics, so participating in the competition is a great way
                    to learn some more mathematics!</p>

                <p>At my middle school, there was a MathCounts club. Though in name it was dedicated to preparing for
                    the MathCounts competition, the MathCounts club was closer to a vehicle through which students could
                    learn math at an accelerated pace, and interact with others who also loved the subject.</p>

            <section id="coaching">
                <h2>Coaching</h2>
                <p>Since I had benefited a lot from the MathCounts club in middle school and thought it was a great way
                    to introduce kids to mathematics, in 9th, 10th, and 11th grade I returned to it as an assistant
                    coach.
                </p>
                <p> In this role, I helped create handouts and homework assignments that would walk students
                    through new mathematical ideas (including counting techniques such as "stars and bars", modular
                    arithmetic, ways to analyze geometric figures, and more). After each handout, I would also provide
                    detailed feedback on students' solutions to help them use them better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would also attend the team's weekly practices, where I helped grade the practice competitions that
                    students took, and helped them with figuring out solutions to these questions after each practice.
                </p>

            <section id="competing">
                <h2>Competing</h2>
                <div class="left-half">
                    <p>In 6th, 7th, and 8th grade, I very much enjoyed participating in my middle school's MathCounts
                        club.
                        <br>
                        Through it, I received my first introduction to competition mathematics, and learned the
                        basics of combinatorics, algebra, number theory, and geometry.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <figure class="right-half img-container">
                    <img src="#" alt="Image unable to load">
                    <figcaption>MathCounts states team .</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>At the club's weekly practices, we would do practice competitions, and then review them. Some older
                    students in high school would help us with with solving the particularly challenging questions
                    during the review period. </p>

                <p>In addition, we had occasionally had homework sets, which were especially fun! Many of the questions
                    challenged me, and I fondly remember spending large parts of my Thanksgiving break engrossed with
                    them.</p>

                <p>In 6th grade, after months of practice I ended up being one spot away from being among the ten
                    students sent to the local competition.
                    <br>
                    In 7th grade, I significantly improved my mathematical skills, and ended up being among the top four
                    individuals at my school. So, I went to the local competition, and succeeded to the state
                    competition where I was 20th in the state.
                    <br>
                    In 8th grade, I continued learning more math, and again went to the state competition, where I had
                    the 5th highest Sprint + Target round score. This qualified me for the countdown round, where I also
                    placed 5th.
                </p>

                <p>Though the club primarily focused on preparing for the MathCounts competition, I attended the
                    Exeter Math Club Competition (EMCC) and Lexington Math Tournament (LMT) with teammates from the
                    club.

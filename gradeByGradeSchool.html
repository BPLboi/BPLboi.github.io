                    <li>Cross Country Club (Fall)</li>
                    <li>Track Team (Spring)</li>

                </ul>
                <p>One major activity I participated in was the KTBYTE Robotics Club. As part of it, 
                    I made a miniature "Firefighter Robot". The robot used the Arduino microcontroller
                    and infrared (IR) sensors to detect flames, and then would turn to extinguish them.

            <h2>9th Grade</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Activities</h3>
                In 9th grade, I participated in many different activities:
                <h4>Lexington Math Team</h4>
                <p>Throughout the year, I was a part of my high school's math team. We had practices 
                    twice every week, where we would help each other learn new mathematical ideas and techniques, 
                    as well as do practice math competitions. Due to how good my school is at math
                     (we had 12 USA(J)MO qualifiers when I was in 9th grade), I learned a lot of more advanced mathematics.
                    As part of the team, I participated in many different math competitions, like DMM, Purple Comet, and much more.
                    Additionally, I helped write questions for the middle-school math tournament that the club runs (LMT). As part
                    of this club, I spent at least 3 hours every week practicing, and many more hours actually going to competitions.
                    Below is a list of all the competitions I went to (potentially incomplete):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Duke Math Meet (DMM)</li>
                    <li>Carnegie Mellon Informatics and Mathematics Competition (CMIMC)</li>
                    <li>Purple Comet</li>
                    <li>ARML Power Round</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>MIT PRIMES STEP</h4>
                <p>This year, I continued being a part of MIT PRIMES STEP, where we would have weekly lessons on various mathematical topics.
                    In addition, throughout the year we worked on researching the Stable Marriage problem, and it's connection to sudoku. This
                    program taught me a ton about about math, but also helped me develop my computer science skills a lot. For research, I often
                    found myself coding simulations of the problem, which could have run for days. However, I spent a lot of time optimizing them,
                    and ended up with a simulation that only took hours. This process helped me learn a lot about coding, and developed my skills a lot.
                </p>

                <p></p>
                <h4>KTBYTE Computer Science Instructor<h4>
                <p>In 9th grade, I continued to teach robotics at KTBYTE computer science academy. More specifically, I taught RS03, the Intermediate level
                    of robotics. There, I taught students more about Arduino and coding in general -- things like arrays, modular arithmetic, Ohm's law, and much more.
                    In addition to being a robotics teacher, I was also part of Office Hours, where people who had questions or needed help with homework could come to get help
                     (from regular coding classes). There, I helped many students with techniques like recursion, floodfill, and much more.

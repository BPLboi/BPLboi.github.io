                <p class = "firstHalf">Welcome to "The Life and Times of Boyan Litchev"! My name is Boyan Litchev, and 
                    currently I'm in 9th grade at Lexington High School.<br><br> In general, some of my 
                    favorite activities are doing math, computer science, and robotics. I also love 
                    building and designing projects, such as miniature vehichles. Additionally, in my free 
                    time I enjoy running and playing video games. <br><br> The purpose of this website 
                    is to outline and compile many of the things that I have done over the years. More 
                    specifically, the "Grade by Grade: School" page outlines the things that I have done 
                    each school year. Similarly, the "Grade by Grade: Summer" page goes 
                    through the things that I have done during the summer each year, such as summer camps
                    and projects. Finally, the "Résumé" page is a collection of the most recent things
                    that I have done. <br><br> <strong>I hope you enjoy my website!</strong> <br>

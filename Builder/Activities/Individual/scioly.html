            <h1>Science Olympiad</h1>
            <section id="overview">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>I participated in Science Olympiad for two years (7th and 8th grade), and over those two years I
                    participated in six events (Circuit Lab, Mousetrap Vehicle, Battery Buggy, Game On, Potions and
                    Poisons, and Mission Possible).
                </p>
                <p>For the 25 years before 2019, Coolidge Middle school had always won
                    first place at the state competition. Then, in 2019, the first year that I was part of the Science
                    Olympiad team, my middle school finally beat them! We really enjoyed going to nationals in 2019!
                </p>
                <p>In 2020, the state and national-level competitions were cancelled due COVID, so I only competed at
                    the Harvard Invitational tournament.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="circuit">
                <h2>Circuit Lab</h2>
                <p><b>Event Goal: </b> to analyze electrical circuits. Sometimes included a practical element.</p>
                <p>I loved this event!!! It merged perfectly with my love for hobby electronics, and helped me
                    understand more of the theory behind how electronic components work. Through the event, I learned
                    basic circuitry concepts such as series/parallel circuits, Ohm and Kirchhoff's laws, and more.</p>

            <section id="mousetrap">
                <h2>Mousetrap Vehicle</h2>
                <div class="left-half">
                    <p><b>Event Goal: </b> to build a mousetrap-powered car that traveled a certain distance (distance
                        revealed at the competition).</p>
                    <p>Though the power source for this vehicle was different, the design we picked was largely based
                        off of the design we used for battery buggy the year before. This vehicle was also lots of fun
                        to build!</p>

            <section id="battery">
                <h2>Battery Buggy</h2>

                <div class="right-half">
                    <p><b>Event Goal:</b> To build a motorized car that traveled a specific distance along a curved
                        path. Distance revealed at the competition.</p>
                    <p>This was by far the funnest Science Olympiad event I ever did, and I put a lot of effort into our
                        buggy! The picture to the left shows what our buggy looked like near the states competition.</p>
                </div>
                <p>After the states competition, slow-motion videos of our test runs revealed that the largest source of
                    the inaccuracy was skidding while the vehicle was slowing down. To combat this, we tested various
                    different tire materials (we eventually settled on the material pictured in the mousetrap vehicle
                    photo), reduced the amount of power going into the motor, and added weights to the vehicle.
                    Additionally, we started using microfiber cloths to clean the floor before our runs.</p>

                <p>In addition, we started utilizing more accurate methods to aim the vehicle. Using two
                    posts (these can be seen in the mousetrap vehicle photo), we attached a rifle scope to the vehicle
                    before starting it, so that we could aim it at a target we would place on the ground. Using
                    extensive testing, we built large tables of precisely where to place the aiming target for various
                    distances to make the vehicle end up as close as possible to the end point.
                </p>

                <p>At nationals, we ended up doing fairly well thanks to my partner Jaime's good predictions for how
                    slippery the floor would be relative to the one on which we had practiced (THANK YOU JAIME!!!)</p>

            <section id="game">
                <h2>Game On</h2>
                <p><b>Event Goal: </b> To make a themed video game in scratch, in one hour.</p>
                <p>I was put on this event since I knew how to code ... and then proceeded to use absolutely no coding
                    knowlege during the event because scratch is really basic and doesn't even let you type code (you
                    have to drag and drop everything).</p>

            <section id="potions">
                <h2>Potions & Poisons</h2>
                <p><b>Event Goal: </b> To answer questions relating to poisonous plants and animals, and basic chemistry
                </p>
                <p>This was a cool event, and participating in it taught me basic chemistry and stoichiometry.</p>

            <section id="possible">
                <h2>Mission Possible</h2>
                <p><b>Event Goal: </b> to make a Rube Goldberg machine that delivered a golf ball to the top of a golf
                    tee.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, no one on my team was particularly interested in this event, including my partner and
                    I. At the Harvard Invitational, my teammate and I got 9th place out of 32 teams by dropping a golf
                    ball onto a piece of paper; many other teams had lost more points from penalties and having large
                    contraptions than they had gained by having more complex machines than my team.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Boyan Litchev, and 
                        as of October 2024, I'm a freshman at the University of Toronto.
                        <br><br>
                        My favorite academic things to do include math, computer science, and robotics, and I am currently
                        studying the first two. In my free time, I fool around, read, and play video games.

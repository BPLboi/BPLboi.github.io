<!-- an interesting bit of code -->
 <!-- Roll your own solution, much like someone does when he/she created a library like the
   one mentioned above. Design some abstraction for your shapes (in this instance some kind of a Bar object)
    that encompasses the relevant features (notably the x,y,w,h) and on canvas mousemove-event,
     bruteforce through all your bars and calculate whether or not the event mouse position is
      within a bar or not. Then act accordingly, e.g. redraw the bar in new color. Of course you'll
       have to handle mouseout as well (to color it back and the like). -->
